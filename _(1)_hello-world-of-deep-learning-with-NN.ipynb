So, for example, for a function like this, we know the 'rules' â€” \n\nx = [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\ny = [-3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7]\n\n```\nfloat hw_function(float x){\n    float y = (2 * x) - 1;\n    return y;\n}\n```\n\nSo how would we train a neural network to do the equivalent task? Using data! By feeding it with a set of Xs, and a set of Ys, it should be able to figure out the relationship between them. \n\nThis is obviously a very different paradigm than what we are be used to in traditional AI approach, so let's step through it piece by piece.\n"
